We focus on a variety of artifacts and cultural productions as the centerpieces of a broad and interdisciplinary exploration of medieval studies. Using specific objects and texts as points of entry into a vanished world, we encourage students to explore those areas that interest them most, teasing out the cultures and beliefs of the past while simultaneously developing their skills in research and writing. Through collaborative projects and a creative exploration of texts, images, and collections at Harvard and beyond, students will be invited to make their own Middle Ages.","","This course fulfills the requirement that one of the eight General Education courses also engage substantially with Study of the Past."
