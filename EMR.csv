The underlying theme is that politics may be described and understood as rational, goal-seeking behavior by citizens, politicians, bureaucrats, and interest groups in various settings. Students are encouraged to think deeply about current events, history, and public life generally, as well as to analyze the politics of private life--in families, clubs, firms, churches, universities, even Harvard Houses--since private politics, like public politics, may be understood in terms of rational behavior.

We address the first of these questions via the second, presenting an interdisciplinary approach to the study of human languages. We investigate language as the product of a natural algorithm, that is, a computational facility which grows spontaneously in our species and enables us to expose our thoughts and feelings. Our investigation uses formal models from logic, linguistics, and computer science. These models will also shed light on human nature and basic philosophical issues concerning language.","","This course fulfills the requirement that one of the eight General Education courses also engage substantially with Study of the Past."
