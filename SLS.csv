They provide a vast range of products and services to human civilization, and are important for economic and cultural reasons. This class will provide students with an introduction to the biology and ecology of forest ecosystems. An overarching theme throughout the course will be to understand how climate change will affect forests and the ecological services we derive from them, and in turn how forests can affect their own growth environment and climate change itself.","",""
