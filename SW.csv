Few elements in the way we live and organize ourselves today are to be taken for granted. There is - and has always been - a wealth of ways in which humans live. But biologically we are the same as our ancestors of 5500 years ago, at the dawn of history. Any likeness or difference between `us and them\' is therefore likely to be a product of history and culture. `Ancient Lives\' builds upon this realization to inspire a critical way of thinking about society in the broadest possible scope. Areas explored during the course are selected for their relevance across the range of contemporary life - they include freedom, music, public health, food, jurisprudence, trade, the visual arts, science, sexuality, religion and political power. You will learn about how societies and individuals have dealt with change on multiple levels, from large-scale societal revolutions to personal transformation. Having taken this course, you will have gained a fundamental understanding and appreciation of human life in the broadest scope, as well as of your own life as a part of history. You will be able to critically assess contemporary discourses on the study of `the other\' in past and present; engage with core concepts of human society, such as justice, beauty, value and belief on a broad historical base; be familiar with examples of classical social theory and thinkers through concrete cases in which their work has been applied to or shaped by the study of the past; and acquire skills in presenting scholarly work to a general audience.","","This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for Societies of the World."

We will assess social responses to these challenges at the community, national, and global levels. Through an understanding of population health measures, we will examine patterns of disease/mortality between and within countries, capture important time trends, and identify determinants of health inequalities. While emphasizing science driven policy, comparative case examples will illuminate influential systemic factors, health system performance, and the economic/social/political climate.","","This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the General Education requirement for either Societies of the World or Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning, but not both."
